# TheMultiStore

The goal of our project is to build a web application that will allow users to view and compare prices of items they would like to purchase online from online shopping stores. Our application will allow the user to search for an item they would like to purchase and go ahead to fetch all the possible entries of the item on sale on some of the biggest online stores such as Tonaton, Jumia and Amazon to mention a few. The user will also be able to filter the search results to suit their preferences.

The website can be viewed at: https://themultistore.000webhostapp.com
